# Machine Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository! My name is Saran Thaworn, This repository contains a collection of my ML projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project are different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

1. [Multi Class Credit Scoring](https://github.com/Saran4B/MachineLearning/tree/main/Multi-Class%20Credit%20Score)
   - **Description:** The multiple classification credit score project predicts the credit scrore target (0 = Good, 1 = Standard, 3 = Poor) of the bank customer 
   - **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification and XGBoost Classification
   - **Results:** The best model for credit score is XGBoost by the accuracy, f1-score, precision score, and recall score and accepted the accuracy at 87.92%
  
2. [Bank Churn Prediction]()
   - **Description:** The Bank churn prediction is a project that analyze the insights of a customer in order to predict customer will leave the bank or not
   - **Technologies Used:** This project uses Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classification, Random Forest Classification and XGBoost Classification
   - **Results:** The best model for credit score is XGBoost by the accuracy, and accepted the accuracy at 86.56%
  
3. [German Credit Prediction]()
   - **Description:** The German Credit Prediction project predicts the creditability (0 = Non Creditiable, 1 = Creditiable)
   - **Technologies Used:** This project uses Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification and XGBoost Classification
   - **Results:** The best model for credit approval by accuracy 76.25% and AUC 0.68 is Random Forest.
